The new age women's safety app based on heatzones is designed to provide real-time information and assistance to women navigating potentially unsafe areas. The app uses advanced technology to map out heatzones, which are areas with higher risk of crimes against women, such as assault and harassment. When a user enters a heatzone, the app will provide them with safety tips and precautions, as well as emergency contacts and a panic button. The app also features a community-driven reporting system, where users can report incidents of harassment and assault, and the app will alert other users in the area. The app aims to empower women to navigate their environment with confidence and security, and to promote awareness and accountability among the community
